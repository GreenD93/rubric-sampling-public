# Code.org to come soon!

We are still working with Code.org to publically release the student solutions to the curriculum. 

For now, we have only synthetic data available generated either from the PCFG or the MVAE, both of which can be found in sub-directories here.

Our apologies for the delay! Email wumike@stanford.edu for inquiries/updates.
